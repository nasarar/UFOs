## Project Overview
A data journalist requires a data visualization and in-depth filtering of a provided dataset. By using javascript, a filter is used to fine tune the results and display it on a web host. The following filters are added to the existing dataset requiring user input:
1. City
2. State
3. Country
4. Shape

## Resources
Data Source: data.js
Software: Visual Studio Code 1.52.1, Bootstrap 4.0.0, Javascript ES6+

## Results

## Summary
Based off of the current filters, the users are now able to filter only the necessary information that is valid to them based off of the criterias provided. Although the current webpage is acceptable due to the dataset provided in one of the files. A database can be set up so that the dataset can easily be expanded without having to manually do it by the webcontent creator. An option for users to input data should be added provided that only select users can do this. Lastly, the dataset should include pictures as evidence if applicable and should be displayed within the tables.
